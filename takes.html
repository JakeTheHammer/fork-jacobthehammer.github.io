<p><b>Cold Takes.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>WYSIWYG web design tools are abominations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Hot Takes.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Computer programs in and of themselves are not art.</li>
  <li>Death Grips and 100 Gecs produce good music.</li>
  <li>If you have fun using a simulator, it's not just a utility. It's a game.</li>
  <li>The McGriddle is the least palatable item on the McDonald's menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Nuclear Takes!</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>StarCraft II is the only good Real Time Strategy game.</li>
    <li>Kanye West is the greatest human artist to ever live. You can just ask him.</li>
    <li>Not only are so-called "E-sports" not sports, chess and decathalon are not sports, either. The word "sport" shouldn't be cheapened to include every possible activity.</li>
