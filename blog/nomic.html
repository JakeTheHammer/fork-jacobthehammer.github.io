<h3>Nomic, the game of changing rules</h3>
<h1>Initial Set of Rules for Nomic</h1>
<p><strong>Immutable Rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>101</strong>
All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-203 (mutable).</p>
<p><strong>102</strong>
Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (ie, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>
<p><strong>103</strong>
A rule change is any of the following:</p>
<p>the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule
the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment
the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa
(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable. Immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed. No rule is absolutely immune to change.)</p>
<p><strong>104</strong>
All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>
<p><strong>106</strong>
Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is voted on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.</p>
<p><strong>107</strong>
No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.</p>
<p><strong>108</strong>
Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number (ordinal number) for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.
If a rule is repealed and then re-enacted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to re-enact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.</p>
<p><strong>109</strong>
Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters.</p>
<p><strong>110</strong>
Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some immutable rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are wholly void and without effect. They do not implicitly transmute immutable rules into mutable rules and at the same time amend them. Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules will be effective if and only if they explicitly state their transmuting effect.</p>
<p><strong>111</strong>
If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguable consists of two or more rule changes compounded, or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides on the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and vote. The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative vote.</p>
<p><strong>112</strong>
The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed from achieving N points to any other state of affairs. However, the magnitude of N and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.</p>
<p><strong>114</strong>
There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>
<p><strong>115</strong>
Rules changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.</p>
<p><strong>116</strong>
Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>
<p>Mutable Rules</p>
<p><strong>202</strong>
One turn consists of two parts, in this order:
proposing one rule change and having it voted on
throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score</p>
<p><strong>205</strong>
An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.</p>
<p><strong>206</strong>
When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.</p>
<p><strong>207</strong>
Each player has exactly one vote.</p>
<p><strong>211</strong>
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type or rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method must again govern.</p>
<p><strong>213</strong>
If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player who is unable to complete a turn is the winner.
This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.</p>
<p><strong>301</strong>
In instances where a proposed immutable or mutable rule is in dispute, the players will defer to Robert’s Rules of Order (“Robert’s Rules”) as a reference. Players will attempt to resolve the dispute following a review of Robert’s Rules. If the dispute cannot be resolved through Robert’s Rules, the issue shall be resolved through adjudication called invoking judgement. Invoking Judgement will remain in force otherwise, and is appended verbatim below:
If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and to decide the question. Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player. Such a process is called invoking judgement.
When judgement has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her own turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.
The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players, taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's judgement is overruled, the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, except that no player is to be Judge during his own turn or during the turn of a teammate.
Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.
New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which judgement was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge's only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit of the game.</p>
<p><strong>303</strong>
A “die” shall be defined as any combination of pseudorandom or random number generators capable of producing an output set O⊇A  where A=\x∈ℤ:0&lt;|x|&lt;7\ and each element in O is equally likely within a commonly accepted tolerance; however, if n may be outside of the set of allowable outcomes A then there should be a vote adhering to standard voting procedure on how to map the set O to the set A.  If no decision is made, the user must roll the die until the output n is an element of A.</p>
<p><strong>304</strong>
A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is passed by a simple majority of the eligible voters.</p>
<p><strong>308</strong>
Players may join the game at any time. New players become eligible voters the turn following the one in which they join.</p>
<p><strong>310</strong>
At no time may there be more than 50 mutable rules.</p>
<p><strong>314</strong>
Upon breaking a rule of this game of Nomic, the offending player will lose 20 points. Disputes over rule breaking should follow standard voting procedure.</p>
<p><strong>316</strong>
Abolish Rule 204</p>
<p><strong>318</strong>
Abolish Rule 312</p>
<p><strong>319</strong>
The winner is the first person to achieve 250 (positive) points.</p>
<p><strong>321</strong>
As a point of order, each player is entitled to his/her own opinions. On anything. Non-players may or may not hold opinions.</p>
<p><strong>325</strong>
A player may not forfeit the game. Upon suggesting they will or would like to forfeit, a player immediately loses 50 points.</p>
<p><strong>326</strong>
The game may be played over an online medium including but not limited to a BBS, IRC, or Discord. Rules regarding quorum and voting remain in effect.</p>
<p><strong>327</strong>
Every player is an eligible voter. Eligible voters may abstain from voting at any time. Simulation games are a subset of video games which are a subset of interactive animation.</p>
<p><strong>328</strong>
Abolish Rule 323</p>
<p><strong>329</strong>
The player order shall be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob H</li>
<li>Joshua K</li>
<li>Thomas M</li>
<li>Brett W</li>
<li>Noah S</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of players may be amended arbitrarily when a new player is added to the game. Players shall take one whole turn apiece. Players may optionally skip or pass their turns but must declare their intention to skip turns verbally or in writing. All players begin with zero points. Any other changes to this rule should follow standard voting procedure.</p>
