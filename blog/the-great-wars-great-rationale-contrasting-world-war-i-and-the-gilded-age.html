</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Reconstruction, recession, and radicalism: The Gilded Age represented some of the most notable social and political changes in American history. Coming straight out of the Civil War, could the United States be plunged into yet another war if the conditions that begat World War I had occurred thirty years earlier? Thankfully, American policies of non-interventionism and isolationism would have stopped this hypothetical hostility from destabilizing the recently-repaired union. Specifically, nationalistic fiscal policy, its undeveloped economy, and internal race conflicts combine into an American conciliation that could never grow to a global war.</p>
<p>Famous for its high tariffs, the Gilded Age was dominated by economic policy supporting laissez-faire with business at home, and by making products from overseas cost prohibitive1. These policies directly contradict those of the Progressive Era and of World War I, where global free trade superseded the desire for a strong national economy. Without the interconnection that global trade brings, there's less incentive for governments to come through to defend trade partners. During the Great War, the United States was roped in primarily by German unrestricted submarine warfare in 1915 and 1918, disrupting valuable trade routes2. Though the Gilded Age Americans may have shown contempt at the German's willingness to sink mercantile ships, they likely would have simply avoided trade with the British mainland until the conflict had resolved itself. Further, the American manufacturing sector was itself burgeoning at this time, and would be unable to support exports to a global market.</p>
<p>So it would seem, Carnegie and his contemporaries were moving towards helping form the American middle class seen in World War I, but it was a work in progress. Despite manufacturing sextupling after the Civil War, income inequality had become worse than it had ever been, or has been since3. Without an equitable income distribution, wartime funding through war bonds would be impossible, and the federal income tax would not be realized until 19004. Without adequate national economic efficacy, the government would not be able to muster the authority to form the War Industries Board5. The iron grip of the captains of industry on public policy certainly would have impeded any government attempts to assume direct control of the free market6. Socialistic policy during the Progressive Era and especially during the war was completed with widespread consent from the general public. Unfortunately, the Congress of the Gilded Age is best described as dysfunctional. Liberal Republicans would ultimately be defeated by laissez-faire Democrats, supporting the corporate status quo, and keeping the government coffers relatively empty compared to the 1910s. Regrettably, income inequality wasn't the only shortcoming of the Federal government distracting the nation from possible war, racial inequality had been as prominent as ever in the Gilded Age.</p>
<p>Alas, despite the Fourteenth Amendment and dozens of reconstruction reformations, the Gilded Age represented a ideological pull towards conservatism that hearkened back to pre-Civil War sentiment in the South that would ultimately be the greatest detractor from any chance of the United States becoming involved in an 1870s World War I. Early on, "New Departure" Democrats whittled down most meaningful protections for liberated African-Americans and introduced racist policy to undermine those rights guaranteed in the Constitutional changes7. These regressive schemata lead to introspection on the part of abolitionists and Republicans, with some women and conservative Republicans supporting the freedom of African-Americans, but not their suffrage8. This split a once-unified cohort,  further weakening government and the fragile fabric of post-reconstruction society. This social exhaustion is central to the Gilded Age government's avoidance of intervention in World War I. Wars are unpopular when there are problems on the home front. The daily racial tension would make the war impossible to market to the Gilded Age American. Even under the tutelage of General Grant, a draft would be disliked, and if servicemen were integrated, there would be few of the millions of Democrats and former Confederates lining up to enlist. Fundamentally, this would leave the Gilded Age military weak in combat, keep the war despised at home, and leave the country vulnerable to a potential second Southern uprising. With all this in mind, World War I would have been categorically illogical for American citizens and the government in the Gilded Age.</p>
<p>Progressivism was on the march at the eve of the Gilded Age. Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson would introduce remedies to cure its ills. However, if the Central Powers had chosen to strike during that era, the United States would be either incapable or unwilling to interfere. Isolationist policy, income inequality, and racial inequality had all hit a fever pitch. Each issue at hand had never been worse up to that point, and arguably have not been worse since. The Gilded Age, noted for its facade of fantastic growth and prosperity, could never have the capacity to function in the total war, globalist paragon that would become the Great War.</p>
